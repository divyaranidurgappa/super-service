Infrastructure implementation details:

To address the requirements outlined in the assessment, I would set up Kubernetes cluster on AWS cloud provider with the following components and configuration.

1. Hosting provider: 
    I would select a cloud provider that offers robust kubernetes services such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes service (EKS). It offers managed kubernetes services 
    which simplifies cluster management and provides scalability.

2. Hosting web services: 
    The Kubernetes cluster would host the web services using Kubernetes Pods and Services. These services would expose endpoints to the internet using 
    either a LoadBalancer service type or an Ingress controller, depending on the specific requirements and preferences.

3. Connectivity Monitoring and Notification: 
    I would configure monitoring and alerting using tools like Prometheus and Grafana (or cloudwatch). Alerts would be set up to notify the support team 
    via email, Slack, or other communication channels if connectivity to the internal assets is lost. This can be achieved by monitoring the health and 
    availability of the web services that interact with the internal systems.

4. Automated Deployment: 
    For automated deployment, I would use Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with tools like Jenkins. Developers would 
    push code changes to version control, triggering automated builds and deployments to the Kubernetes cluster. Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests 
    would be used to define the application deployment configurations.                   

5. Secure Access to Internal Systems: 
    To securely access pre-existing internal systems on the "internal-assets" virtual network, I would set up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) between 
    the Kubernetes cluster and the internal network. This ensures secure and private communication between the Kubernetes cluster and the internal 
    systems without exposing them to the public internet. Additionally, I would configure Kubernetes network policies to restrict traffic within the 
    cluster and enforce security controls.
